Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 1.6.1 (October 10, 2023)

ENHANCEMENTS:
* backend/s3: The `skip_requesting_account_id` argument supports AWS API implementations that do not have the IAM, STS, or metadata API. ([#34002](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34002))

BUG FIXES:
* config: Using sensitive values as one or both of the results of a conditional expression will no longer crash. [GH-33996]
* config: Conditional expression returning refined-non-null result will no longer crash. [GH-33996]
* cli: Reverted back to previous behavior of ignoring signing key expiration for provider installation, since it's the provider registry's responsibility to verify key validity at publication time. [GH-34004]
* cli: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` is now preserved again when fetching modules from git source addresses. [GH-34045]
* cloud: The `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable works with the `cloud` block again; it can specify a workspace when none is configured, or select an active workspace when the config specifies `tags`. [GH-34012]
* backend/s3: S3, DynamoDB, IAM, and STS endpoint parameters will no longer fail validation if the parsed scheme or hostname is empty. ([#34017](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34017))
* backend/s3: Providing a key alias to the `kms_key_id` argument will no longer fail validation. ([#33993](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33993))
