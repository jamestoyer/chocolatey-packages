Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.14.3 (December 17, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `terraform output`: Now supports a new "raw" mode, activated by the `-raw` option, for printing out the raw string representation of a particular output value. ([#27212](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27212))

    Only primitive-typed values have a string representation, so this formatting mode is not compatible with complex types. The `-json` mode is still available as a general way to get a machine-readable representation of an output value of any type.
    
* config: `for_each` now allows maps whose _element values_ are sensitive, as long as the element keys and the map itself are not sensitive. ([#27247](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27247))

BUG FIXES:

* config: Fix `anytrue` and `alltrue` functions when called with values which are not known until apply. ([#27240](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27240))
* config: Fix `sum` function when called with values which are not known until apply. Also allows `sum` to cope with numbers too large to represent in float64, along with correctly handling errors around infinite values. ([#27249](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27249))
* config: Fixed panic when referencing sensitive values in resource `count` expressions ([#27238](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27238))
* config: Fix incorrect attributes in diagnostics when validating objects ([#27010](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27010))
* core: Prevent unexpected updates during plan when multiple sensitive values are involved ([#27318](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27318))
* dependencies: Fix several small bugs related to the use of `sensitive` values with expressions and functions.
* lang: Fix panic when calling `coalescelist` with a `null` argument ([#26988](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26988))
* `terraform apply`: `-refresh=false` was skipped when running apply directly ([#27233](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27233))
* `terraform init`: setting `-get-plugins` to `false` will now cause a warning, as this flag has been a no-op since 0.13.0 and usage is better served through using `provider_installation` blocks ([#27092](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27092))
* `terraform init` and other commands which interact with the dependency lock file: These will now generate a normal error message if the lock file is incorrectly a directory, rather than crashing as before. ([#27250](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27250))
