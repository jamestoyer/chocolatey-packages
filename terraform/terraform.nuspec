Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

## 1.3.5 (November 17, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* Prevent crash while serializing the plan for an empty destroy operation ([#32207](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32207))
* Allow a destroy plan to refresh instances while taking into account that some may no longer exist ([#32208](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32208))
* Fix Terraform creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
* Fix several Terraform crashes that are caused by HCL creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects within collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
* Fix inconsistent behaviour in empty vs null collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
* Prevent file uploads from creating unneeded temporary files when the payload size is known ([#32206](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32206))
* Nested attributes marked sensitive by schema no longer reveal sub-attributes in the plan diff ([#32004](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32004))
* Nested attributes now more consistently display when they become unknown or null values in the plan diff ([#32004](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32004))
* Sensitive values are now always displayed as `(sensitive value)` instead of sometimes as `(sensitive)` [GH32004]
