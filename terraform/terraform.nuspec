Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.12.20 (January 22, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:
* config: New built-in functions `try` and `can` are intended to ease working with data structures whose shape isn't known statically. ([#23794](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23794))
* config: New, optional syntax for [`required_providers`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#specifying-required-provider-versions) setting in `terraform` blocks. This is not intended for general use yet but will support upcoming enhancements. [[#23843](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23843)] 

BUG FIXES:
* command/show: Fix an issue with show and aliased providers ([#23848](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23848))
* core: Always clean up empty resources before empty modules ([#23822](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23822))
* internal/modsdir/manifest: Fix CLI issue with Windows machines ([#23865](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23865))

EXPERIMENTS:

* This release includes an _opt-in experiment_ for [custom validation rules on module variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules).

    The feature is not yet finalized and is subject to breaking changes even in minor releases, but we're introducing it here in order to solicit feedback from module developers about which use-cases it is meeting, any use-cases it _isn't_ meeting, and any situations where things feel harder to express than they might be.

    Due to the experimental nature of this feature, we do not recommend using it in "production" modules yet and we require an explicit [experimental feature opt-in](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features) of `variable_validation`. Depending on what feedback we receive, the design of this experimental feature may change significantly in future versions without an automatic upgrade path.
