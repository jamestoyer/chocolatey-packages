    <description>
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

    <releaseNotes>
## 1.9.0-alpha20240404 (April 4, 2024)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `terraform console`: Now has basic support for multi-line input in interactive mode. ([#34822](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34822))

    If an entered line contains opening paretheses/etc that are not closed, Terraform will await another line of input to complete the expression. This initial implementation is primarily intended to support pasting in multi-line expressions from elsewhere, rather than for manual multi-line editing, so the interactive editing support is currently limited.

BUG FIXES:

* `remote-exec`: Each remote connection will be closed immediately after use ([#34137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34137))
* `backend/s3`: Fixed the digest value displayed for DynamoDB/S3 state checksum mismatches ([#34387](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34387))

EXPERIMENTS:

Experiments are only enabled in alpha releases of Terraform CLI. The following features are not yet available in stable releases.

* `terraform test` accepts a new option `-junit-xml=FILENAME`. If specified, and if the test configuration is valid enough to begin executing, then Terraform writes a JUnit XML test result report to the given filename, describing similar information as included in the normal test output. ([#34291](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34291))
* The new command `terraform rpcapi` exposes some Terraform Core functionality through an RPC interface compatible with [`go-plugin`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin). The exact RPC API exposed here is currently subject to change at any time, because it's here primarily as a vehicle to support the [Terraform Stacks](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-stacks-explained) private preview and so will be broken if necessary to respond to feedback from private preview participants, or possibly for other reasons. Do not use this mechanism yet outside of Terraform Stacks private preview.
* The experimental "deferred actions" feature, enabled by passing the `-allow-deferral` option to `terraform plan`, permits `count` and `for_each` arguments in `module`, `resource`, and `data` blocks to have unknown values and allows providers to react more flexibly to unknown values. This experiment is under active development, and so it's not yet useful to participate in this experiment.
