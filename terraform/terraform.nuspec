Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

## 1.4.1 (March 15, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

* Enables overriding modules that have the `depends_on` attribute set, while still preventing the `depends_on` attribute itself from being overridden. ([#32796](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32796))
* `terraform providers mirror`: when a dependency lock file is present, mirror the resolved providers versions, not the latest available based on configuration. ([#32749](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32749))
* Fixed module downloads from S3 URLs when using AWS IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA). ([#32700](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32700))
* hcl: Fix a crash in Terraform when attempting to apply defaults into an incompatible type. ([#32775](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32775))
* Prevent panic when creating a plan which errors before the planning process has begun. ([#32818](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32818))
* Fix the plan renderer skipping the "no changes" messages when there are no-op outputs within the plan. ([#32820](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32820))
* Prevent panic when rendering null nested primitive values in a state output. ([#32840](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32840))
* Warn when an invalid path is specified in `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` ([#32846](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32846))
