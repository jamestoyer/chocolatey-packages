Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

## 0.13.1 (August 26, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* config: `cidrsubnet` and `cidrhost` now support address extensions of more than 32 bits ([#25517](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25517))
* cli: The directories that Terraform searches by default for provider plugins can now be symlinks to directories elsewhere. (This applies only to the top-level directory, not to nested directories inside it.) ([#25692](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25692))
* backend/s3: simplified mock handling and assume role testing ([#25903](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25903))
* backend/s3: support for appending data to the User-Agent request header with the TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT environment variable ([#25903](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25903))

BUG FIXES:
* config: Override files containing `module` blocks can now override the special `providers` argument. ([#25496](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25496))
* cli: The state lock will now be unlocked consistently across both the local and remote backends in the `terraform console` and `terraform import` commands. [[#25454](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25454)] 
* cli: The `-target` option to `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` now correctly handles addresses containing module instance indexes. ([#25760](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25760))
* cli: `terraform state mv` can now move the last resource from a module without panicking. ([#25523](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25523))
* cli: If the output of `terraform version` contains an outdated version notice, this is now printed after the version number and not before. ([#25811](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25811))
* command: Prevent creation of workspaces with invalid names via the `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable, and allow any existing invalid workspaces to be deleted. ([#25262](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25262))
* command: Fix error when multiple `-no-color` flags are set on the command line. ([#25847](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25847))
* command: Fix backend config override validation, allowing the use of `-backend-config` override files with the enhanced remote backend. ([#25960](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25960))
* core: State snapshots now use a consistent ordering for resources that have the same name across different modules. Previously the ordering was undefined. ([#25498](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25498))
* core: A `dynamic` block producing an unknown number of blocks will no longer incorrectly produce the error "Provider produced inconsistent final plan" when the block type is backed by a set of objects. ([#25662](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25662))
* core: Terraform will now silently drop attributes that appear in the state but are not present in the corresponding resource type schema, on the assumption that those attributes existed in a previous version of the provider and have now been removed. ([#25779](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25779))
* core: The state upgrade logic for handling unqualified provider addresses from Terraform v0.11 and earlier will no longer panic when it encounters references to the built-in `terraform` provider. ([#25861](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25861))
* internal: Clean up provider package download temporary files after installing. ([#25990](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25990))
* terraform: Evaluate module call arguments for `terraform import` even if defaults are given for input variables ([#25890](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25890))
* terraform: Fix misleading Terraform `required_version` constraint diagnostics when multiple `required_version` settings exist in a single module ([#25898](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25898))
