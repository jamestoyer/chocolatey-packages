Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

## 1.0.5 (August 18, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

* json-output: Add an output change summary message as part of the `terraform plan -json` structured logs, bringing this format into parity with the human-readable UI. ([#29312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29312))
* core: Handle null nested single attribute values ([#29411](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29411))
* cli: Fix crash when planning a diff between null and empty sets in nested attributes ([#29398](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29398))
* cli: Fix crash when planning a new resource containing a set of nested object attributes ([#29398](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29398))
* cli: Fix crash when displaying a resource diff where a possibly identifying attribute is sensitive ([#29397](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29397))
* cli: Fix crash when a diff with unknown nested map attributes ([#29410](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29410))
* config: Fix handling of dynamically types arguments in `formatlist`, ensuring the correct resulting type. ([#29408](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29408))
* config: Floating point operations like `floor` and `ceil` can no longer mutate their arguments. ([#29408](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29408))
