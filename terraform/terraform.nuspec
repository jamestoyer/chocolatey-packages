Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.14.1 (December 08, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* backend/remote: When using the enhanced remote backend with commands which locally modify state, verify that the local Terraform version and the configured remote workspace Terraform version are compatible. This prevents accidentally upgrading the remote state to an incompatible version. The check is skipped for commands which do not write state, and can also be disabled by the use of a new command-line flag, `-ignore-remote-version`. ([#26947](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26947))

BUG FIXES:

* configs: Fix for errors when using multiple layers of sensitive input variables ([#27095](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27095))
* configs: Fix error when using sensitive input variables in conditionals ([#27107](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27107))
* core: Fix permanent diff when a resource changes only in sensitivity, for example due to changing the sensitivity of a variable or output used as an attribute value. ([#27128](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27128))
* core: Fix issues where `ignore_changes` appears to not work, or causes validation errors with some resources. ([#27141](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27141))
* `terraform fmt`: Fix incorrect formatting with attribute expressions enclosed in parentheses. ([#27040](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/27040))
